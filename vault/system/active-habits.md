# Active Habits (Binary Tracking)

> Add/remove habits here. Daily note template pulls from this list.
> Use #habit/tag format for Dataview tracking.

- #habit/exercise — Worked out
- #habit/reading — Read 30 min
- #habit/writing — Wrote something

> Customize these to your own habits. Keep them binary (done/not done).
> Quantitative tracking (reps, pages, etc.) goes in your journal or a separate tracker.
